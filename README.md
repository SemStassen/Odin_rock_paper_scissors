# Odin_rock_paper_scissors

This is my first project in the Odin Project Curriculum that combines javascript with html and css.
I opted not to focus too much on the UI aspect as I felt that javascript is the language I need to practice most.
Nevertheless I managed to build a website which scales to most screen sizes using percentages instead of mediaQueries.
I was able to do this because the website didn't need any scrollbars to function.

All in all I feel like i've learned a lot working on this project. The most important thing being refactoring my JS code in order to make it cleaner and work more efficiently.
